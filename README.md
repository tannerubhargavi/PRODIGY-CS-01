# Caesar Cipher

This program uses the Caesar cipher technique to encrypt and decrypt messages.

## Program's Features

- Allows users to input a message to be encrypted or decrypted
- Offers a choice between encryption and decryption
- Accepts a shift value for the cipher
- Handles non-alphabetic characters in the message
- Outputs the resulting message after encryption or decryption

## Python Features Used

This program was developed using Python programming language and it uses the following features of Python:

- Lists
- Loops
- Conditional statements
- Functions
- User input

## How to run and use

To run the program, simply download the code and run it in your preferred Python environment. Once the program is running, the user will be prompted to choose whether to 'encode' or 'decode' a message. The user will then enter the message and the shift amount. The program will then display the encrypted or decrypted message, based on the user's selection. The user can then choose to run the program again or exit.

To use this program effectively, the user must have a basic understanding of the Caesar cipher technique and how to choose an appropriate shift amount.
